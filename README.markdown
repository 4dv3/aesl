# FetLife Age/Sex/Location Search

The FetLife Age/Sex/Location Search user script allows you to search for profiles on [FetLife](https://fetlife.com/) by age, sex, location, or orientation. This user script imlements what is, as of this writing, the [most popular suggestion in the FetLife suggestion box](https://fetlife.com/improvements/78):

> Search for people by Location/Sex/Orientation/Age
>
> Increase the detail of the kinkster search by allowing us to narrow the definition of the search by the traditional fields.

With the FetLife Age/Sex/Location Search user script installed, a few clicks will save hours of time. Now you can find profiles that match your specified criteria in a matter of seconds. The script even lets you send a message to the profiles you found right from the search results list.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Before you report a new issue with FetLife Age/Sex/Location Search, please check to ensure your question is not already addressed in the list below.

* [Can I search in a location other than "near me"?](#can-i-search-in-a-location-other-than-near-me)
* [Why can I only search for men, not women?](#why-can-i-only-search-for-men-not-women)

### Can I search in a location other than "near me"?

The current version of FetLife Age/Sex/Location Search doesn't provide an interface for you to choose a location directly. However, you can temporarily change the location you list on your own profile to search in different regions. In other words, if you're currently in New York City but want to search for people in Tokyo, temporarily change your FetLife profile's location to Tokyo and run your search again. Afterwards, you can change your FetLife profile's location back to New York City.

### Why can I only search for men, not women?

Because fuck you [that's why](http://www.notjustbitchy.com/?p=496).
